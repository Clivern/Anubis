Peanut provides a REST API, Admin Dashboard and a command line tool to deploy and configure the commonly used services like databases, message brokers, graphing, tracing, caching tools ... etc. It perfectly suited for development, manual testing, automated testing pipelines where mocking is not possible and test drives.

Under the hood, it works with the containerization runtime like docker to deploy and configure the service. Destroy the service if it is a temporary one.

Technically you can achieve the same with a bunch of yaml files or using a configuration management tool or a package manager like helm but peanut is pretty small and fun to use & should speed up your workflow!
