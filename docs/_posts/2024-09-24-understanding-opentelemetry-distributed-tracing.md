Distributed Tracing is a technique to keep track of requests as they flow from the frontend layers through a complex distributed backend systems, Mainly those built in a microservices architecture.


### How Distributed Tracing Works

- **Request Initiation:** When a request is initiated (e.g., a user submits a form), it is assigned a unique identifier known as a `Trace ID`. This Trace ID remains with the request throughout its lifecycle across multiple distributed services.
- **Span Creation:** As the request moves through different services, each service generates `spans`, which are individual units of work representing operations performed during the request's journey. Each `span` includes:
    * Start and End Timestamps: To measure the duration of the operation.
    * Span ID: A unique identifier for each span.
    * Metadata: Additional information such as service name, operation type, and error status.
- **Data Collection:** Each service logs its span data, associating it with the original `Trace ID`. This allows for the reconstruction of the entire request flow, enabling developers to see how requests interact with various services and where delays or errors occur
- **Visualization:** Distributed tracing tools often visualize this data using diagrams. These visualizations help identify performance bottlenecks by showing where time is spent within each service and how services interact.

Here is a diagram explaining the above steps

### Benefits of Distributed Tracing

- Analyze request flows within a complex architecture to detect latency issues and optimize performance.
- We can quickly identify where failures occur within complex service interactions.
- Measure key user actions and identify backend bottlenecks affecting user satisfaction
- Faster resolution of issues by easily locating the failures within a complex service interactions.


### Key Components of Distributed Tracing

- `Trace ID`: A unique identifier that ties together all spans associated with a single request.
- `Trace`: A tree of spans that shows the path that a request makes through an app. The root span is the first span in a trace.
- `Span`: Represent individual operations within a trace, capturing details about each step taken by the system.
- `Instrumentation`: The process of modifying application code to generate tracing data. frameworks like OpenTelemetry facilitate this.
