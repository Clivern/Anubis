My heart is shattered. He was taken from us too soon in a car accident. He was my best friend and the most loving brother a person could ask for. The thought that I can't see him anymore is a pain I can't bear.

He leaves behind a void that can never be filled, but his memory will forever be cherished. I will miss his goofy jokes, our late-night talks, and the way he always knew how to make me smile.
